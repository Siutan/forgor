### Enhanced Shell History (Recommended)

For the best experience, `forgor` can use an enhanced shell logger that provides rich, real-time, cross-session history.

This logger provides more context than native shell history:

- Captures commands from all terminal sessions instantly.
- Includes context like the working directory for each command.
- Sanitizes sensitive arguments (e.g., passwords, API keys) automatically through a filter list.

In saying this, please note that the enhanced logger is not a replacement for native shell history. and although it itself doesn't send commands to an external API, it can still be sent to LLMs so do be aware of the potential risks of any keys or secrets you might have in your history.

You can disable history completely by setting `history: 0` in your configuration file.

#### Install the Enhanced Logger

Run the following command to install the logger script. It will automatically detect your shell (`bash`, `zsh`, or `fish`) and configure it.

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Siutan/forgor/main/scripts/configure-history-logger.sh | bash
```

After running, **restart your shell** to activate it. The logger does not overwrite your history file, it hooks into the `command has run` event and logs each command to the `~/.command_log` file.

#### Uninstall the Logger

If you need to remove the logger, a simple uninstall script is provided:

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Siutan/forgor/main/scripts/reset-history-logger.sh | bash
```

## üöÄ Installation

### Quick Install

```bash
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Siutan/forgor/refs/heads/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

### Add to PATH

If the install script doesn't automatically add the binary to your PATH, add it manually

### Create Alias (Recommended)

For convenience, create an alias to use `ff` instead of typing `forgor`:

```bash
# Add to your shell profile (.bashrc, .zshrc, etc.)
alias ff="forgor"

# Source your profile
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc, ~/.bash_profile, etc.
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
forgor --version
# or with alias
ff --version
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

### 1. Initialize Configuration

```bash
forgor config init
```

This creates a default configuration at `~/.config/forgor/config.yaml`.

### 2. Set API Keys

Configure your preferred LLM provider by setting environment variables:

```bash
# For OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# For Anthropic Claude
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# For Google Gemini
export GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

Add these to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.) to persist them.

### 3. Set Default Provider

```bash
forgor config set-default openai      # or anthropic, gemini
```

### 4. Setup Shell Completion (Optional)

```bash
forgor config completion              # Auto-detect shell
# or specify shell explicitly
forgor config completion zsh
```

---

## üßæ Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Basic command generation
forgor "find all txt files containing 'hello'"

# With alias (if configured)
ff "show me how to make a new tmux session called dev"
```

### History-Aware Commands

```bash
# Include last 2 commands from history for context
forgor --history 2 "fix the above command"

# Short form
forgor -n 1 "make the last command safer"
```

### Different Modes

```bash
# Explain what a command does
forgor --explain "docker rm -f \$(docker ps -aq)"

# Interactive mode with follow-ups
forgor --interactive "help me set up a web server"

# Force run the generated command (DANGEROUS - use carefully)
forgor --force-run "list all files in current directory"
```

### Using Different Providers

```bash
# Use a specific provider profile
forgor --profile anthropic "optimize this bash script"

# Check available providers
forgor config list-providers
```

---

## üìã Examples

### File Operations

```bash
forgor "recursively find all Python files modified in the last 7 days"
# Output: find . -name "*.py" -mtime -7

forgor "compress the current directory excluding node_modules"
# Output: tar --exclude='node_modules' -czf archive.tar.gz .
```

### Docker Commands

```bash
forgor "stop all running containers"
# Output: docker stop $(docker ps -q)

forgor "remove all unused docker images"
# Output: docker image prune -a
```

### System Administration

```bash
forgor "show processes using port 8080"
# Output: lsof -i :8080

forgor "find large files over 100MB in home directory"
# Output: find ~ -type f -size +100M
```

### Git Operations

```bash
forgor "undo the last commit but keep changes"
# Output: git reset --soft HEAD~1

forgor "show git log in one line format"
# Output: git log --oneline
```

## üîß Configuration

### Configuration File

The configuration file is located at `~/.config/forgor/config.yaml`:

```yaml
default_profile: "openai"

  openai:
    provider: "openai"
    api_key: "${OPENAI_API_KEY}"
    model: "gpt-4"
    max_tokens: 150

  anthropic:
    provider: "anthropic"
    api_key: "${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}"

    temperature: 0.1

  gemini:
    provider: "gemini"
    api_key: "${GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY}"
    model: "gemini-1.5-flash"
    max_tokens: 150
    temperature: 0.1

history:
  max_commands: 10
  shells: ["bash", "zsh", "fish"]
