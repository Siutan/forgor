# Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline

This document explains the CI/CD pipeline for the `forgor` CLI tool.

## Overview

The CI pipeline automatically builds, tests, and validates every pull request to ensure code quality and cross-platform compatibility. It consists of multiple jobs that run in parallel for efficiency.

## Automated Release Process

When a PR is merged to main, the following automated process occurs:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[PR Merged to Main] --> B[Auto Release Workflow]
    B --> C{VERSION file<br/>bumped?}
    C -->|Yes| D{Tag exists?}
    C -->|No| E[Skip Release]
    D -->|No| F[Create Tag v{VERSION}]
    D -->|Yes| G[Skip Release]
    F --> H[Release Workflow Triggered]
    H --> I[Build for All Platforms]
    I --> J[Create GitHub Release]
    J --> K[Upload Binaries & Checksums]
```

**Key Points**:
- ‚úÖ **Automatic**: No manual intervention required
- ‚úÖ **Safe**: Multiple checks prevent duplicate releases
- ‚úÖ **Fast**: Parallel builds for all platforms
- ‚úÖ **Complete**: Includes binaries, checksums, and release notes

## Workflows

### 1. CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

Triggers on:

- **Pull requests** to `main` branch
- **Pushes** to `main` branch

#### Jobs Overview

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Lint & Format] --> D[Integration Test]
    B[Test] --> D
    C[Build Matrix] --> D
    A --> E[Cross-platform Build]
    B --> E
    F[Security Scan] --> G[Summary]
    D --> G
    E --> G
```

#### Job Details

**üîç Lint & Format Job**

- Checks code formatting with `gofmt`
- Runs `go vet` for static analysis
- Executes `golangci-lint` for comprehensive linting
- Verifies Go module integrity

**üß™ Test Job**

- Runs all unit tests with race detection
- Generates code coverage reports
- Enforces minimum coverage threshold (50%)
- Uploads coverage artifacts

**üî® Build Matrix Job**

- Tests builds on multiple OS: Ubuntu, macOS, Windows
- Tests with Go versions: 1.20, 1.21
- Verifies binary execution
- Uploads build artifacts

**üåç Cross-platform Build Job** (PRs only)

- Builds for all target platforms:
  - Linux (amd64, arm64, arm)
  - macOS (amd64, arm64)
  - Windows (amd64)
- Creates checksums
- Uploads cross-platform artifacts

**üîê Security Scan Job**

- Runs Gosec security scanner
- Uploads SARIF results for GitHub Security tab

**üìä Integration Test Job**

- Downloads and tests actual binary
- Validates CLI commands work correctly
- Tests help output and version information

**üìã Summary Job**

- Collects results from all jobs
- Creates GitHub Step Summary
- Shows overall CI status

### 2. Version Check Workflow (`.github/workflows/version-check.yml`)

**Purpose**: Enforces version bumps on every PR/push to main

**What it checks**:

- VERSION file exists and has valid format
- Version is increased for PRs
- New version is greater than previous version

### 3. Auto Release Workflow (`.github/workflows/auto-release.yml`)

**Purpose**: Automatically creates tags and releases when PRs are merged to main

**How it works**:

1. **Triggers** on pushes to main branch (from merged PRs)
2. **Reads** the VERSION file to get the current version
3. **Validates** the version format (semver: X.Y.Z)
4. **Checks** if the tag already exists (prevents duplicates)
5. **Verifies** this is actually a PR merge (not a direct push)
6. **Creates** a git tag with the version (e.g., v0.2.1)
7. **Pushes** the tag, which triggers the Release Workflow

**Smart detection**:
- Only runs on PR merges, not direct pushes
- Skips if tag already exists
- Validates version format before proceeding

### 4. Release Workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)

**Purpose**: Builds and publishes releases when version tags are pushed

**Triggered by**: Auto Release Workflow (or manual tag pushes)

**Features**:

- Builds for all platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Creates GitHub releases with binaries
- Attaches checksums for verification
- Extracts changelog information (if available)
- Supports pre-releases (versions with - suffix)

## CI Requirements

### For Pull Requests

All of these must pass before merging:

‚úÖ **Code Quality**

- Code must be properly formatted (`gofmt`)
- Must pass static analysis (`go vet`, `golangci-lint`)
- No linting errors or warnings

‚úÖ **Testing**

- All tests must pass
- Test coverage must be ‚â• 50%
- Race conditions must not be detected

‚úÖ **Building**

- Must build successfully on all target platforms
- Binary must execute without errors
- Version information must be embedded correctly

‚úÖ **Security**

- Must pass security scanning
- No known vulnerabilities

‚úÖ **Versioning**

- Version format must be valid SemVer

### For Main Branch

Additional requirements for pushes to main:

‚úÖ **Version Enforcement**

- Every commit must increase the version
- Version history must be monotonic

## Artifacts

The CI pipeline produces several artifacts:

### Test Artifacts

- `coverage-report`: HTML and raw coverage files
- Available for 90 days

### Build Artifacts

- `forgor-{os}-go{version}`: Platform-specific binaries
- `forgor-cross-platform-pr{number}`: All platform binaries (PRs only)
- Available for 30 days

### Security Artifacts

- SARIF security scan results
- Automatically uploaded to GitHub Security tab

## Local Development

### Running CI Checks Locally

```bash
# Format code
make fmt

# Run linting
make lint

# Run tests with coverage
make test-coverage

# Build for current platform
make build

# Build for all platforms
make build-all

# Check version format
make version-check
```

### Pre-commit Checklist

Before creating a PR, ensure:

```bash
# 1. Code is formatted
make fmt

# 2. Tests pass
make test

# 3. Version is bumped (for main branch PRs)
make version-bump-patch  # or minor/major

# 4. Build works
make build

# 5. Lint passes
make lint  # (optional, CI will catch this)
```

## Configuration

### Coverage Threshold

The minimum test coverage is set to **50%** in the CI workflow:

```yaml
THRESHOLD=50
if (( $(echo "$COVERAGE < $THRESHOLD" | bc -l) )); then
echo "‚ùå Test coverage ($COVERAGE%) is below threshold ($THRESHOLD%)"
exit 1
fi
```

To change this, modify the `THRESHOLD` value in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

### Supported Platforms

The CI builds and tests on:

**Development Testing:**

- Ubuntu Latest + Go 1.20, 1.21
- macOS Latest + Go 1.20, 1.21
- Windows Latest + Go 1.20, 1.21

**Release Targets:**

- linux/amd64, linux/arm64, linux/arm
- darwin/amd64, darwin/arm64
- windows/amd64

### Build Flags

All binaries are built with version information:

```bash
LDFLAGS="-X 'forgor/cmd.Version=$VERSION' -X 'forgor/cmd.GitCommit=$COMMIT' -X 'forgor/cmd.BuildDate=$BUILD_DATE'"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common CI Failures

**‚ùå Formatting Issues**

```bash
# Fix locally
make fmt
git add . && git commit -m "fix: code formatting"
```

**‚ùå Test Failures**

```bash
# Run tests locally
make test
# Fix failing tests, then commit
```

**‚ùå Coverage Too Low**

```bash
# Check current coverage
make test-coverage
# Add more tests to increase coverage
```

**‚ùå Version Not Bumped**

```bash
# Bump version for PR
make version-bump-patch
git add VERSION && git commit -m "chore: bump version"
```

**‚ùå Build Failures**

```bash
# Test build locally
make build
# Fix build issues, then commit
```

### Debug CI Issues

1. **Check job logs** in GitHub Actions tab
2. **Download artifacts** to inspect build outputs
3. **Run equivalent commands locally** using Makefile targets
4. **Check dependencies** with `go mod verify`

### CI Performance

The CI pipeline is optimized for speed:

- **Parallel jobs** run simultaneously when possible
- **Go module caching** reduces dependency download time
- **Build matrix** tests multiple configurations efficiently
- **Conditional jobs** (cross-platform build only on PRs)

Typical CI run time: **3-5 minutes** for PRs

## Security

### SARIF Integration

Security scan results are automatically uploaded to GitHub's Security tab, providing:

- **Vulnerability detection** in dependencies
- **Code security analysis** with Gosec
- **Centralized security dashboard**

### Artifact Security

- Build artifacts are **temporary** (30-90 days)
- No secrets are included in build outputs
- Version information is embedded safely

## GitHub Integration

### Status Checks

All CI jobs appear as **required status checks** on PRs:

- `lint-and-format`
- `test`
- `build`
- `integration-test`
- `security-scan`

### PR Summary

The Summary job creates a detailed report in the PR:

```
## CI Summary

‚úÖ **Lint & Format**: Passed
‚úÖ **Tests**: Passed
‚úÖ **Build**: Passed
‚úÖ **Cross-platform Build**: Passed
‚úÖ **Integration Tests**: Passed

**PR is ready for review!** üéâ
```

This system ensures every change to `forgor` maintains high quality and works reliably across all supported platforms.

## Release Process

### For Contributors

**To create a release**, simply:

1. **Bump the version** in the `VERSION` file
2. **Create a PR** with your changes
3. **Merge the PR** - the release happens automatically!

**Version format**: Use semantic versioning (e.g., `1.2.3`)
- **Patch** (1.2.3 ‚Üí 1.2.4): Bug fixes
- **Minor** (1.2.3 ‚Üí 1.3.0): New features (backwards compatible)
- **Major** (1.2.3 ‚Üí 2.0.0): Breaking changes

### What Happens Automatically

When your PR is merged:

1. ‚úÖ **Auto Release Workflow** detects the PR merge
2. ‚úÖ **Version** is read from `VERSION` file  
3. ‚úÖ **Tag** is created (e.g., `v1.2.3`)
4. ‚úÖ **Release Workflow** builds binaries for all platforms
5. ‚úÖ **GitHub Release** is created with downloads

### Manual Releases (If Needed)

You can also create releases manually:

```bash
# Create and push a tag
git tag v1.2.3
git push origin v1.2.3

# The release workflow will automatically trigger
```

### Pre-releases

For pre-release versions, use a suffix:

```
1.2.3-beta.1
1.2.3-rc.1
1.2.3-alpha.2
```

These will be marked as "pre-release" on GitHub.

### Release Artifacts

Each release includes:

- **Binaries** for all supported platforms
- **Checksums** (SHA256) for verification
- **Release notes** (auto-generated or from CHANGELOG.md)
- **Source code** (automatically attached by GitHub)
